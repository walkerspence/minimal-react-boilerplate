# Minimal react boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then modified to use typescript, and alternate file structure, and custom typescript, eslint and prettier config, disabling certain extraneous rules and allowing for this use of absolute imports.
## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test:watch`

### `npm run build`
